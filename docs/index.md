This project was started as a simple library to manage command line arguments in php. After having it 
around in my toolbox for a while I decided to opensource the project for others to use as well.

The project was initially based on the work of [Joe Tannenbaum](https://github.com/joetannenbaum) with his [Climate](https://github.com/thephpleague/climate)
package but changed over the years to be my own.


## Unit Tests

If you wish to run any tests on this package you can run:

```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/pest
```

or

```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
