# redbox-cli
This is a command line parser based on [Climate](https://github.com/thephpleague/climate)  by [Joe Tannenbaum](https://github.com/joetannenbaum). We share a lot of similarities but i desided to take the getopt route and downgrade the number of lines in the code by 1/4 of the original size.
