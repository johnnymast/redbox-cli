This project was started as a simple library to manage command line arguments in php. After having it 
around in my toolbox for a while I decided to opensource the project for others to use as well.

The project was initially based on the work of [Joe Tannenbaum](https://github.com/joetannenbaum) with his [Climate](https://github.com/thephpleague/climate)
package but changed over the years to be my own.


## Unit Testing

With the new 1.2 release we increased the test ratio from 64% in previous versions to 95% and that is making me proud. Also with the new release i have found a way to unit test the core component of this package (getopt(). While doing this we can make sure your implementation
of Redbox-cli will run like a sunshine with any of your projects. If you want a little of what our new tests cover that was not possible before, checkout our [examples](examples) directory for some great examples on how to use this great package.
