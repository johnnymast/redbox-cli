## So you want to contribute

First of all thanks for you consideration. There is a couple steps to take.

### Setup

 * First things first you will need a fork of the code. You can use the fork button on Github to accomplish this
 * Create a new branch named like **username-your_awesome_new_feature**
 * Make your changes
 * Commit your changes
 * Don't forget to push them to your repository (remember your branch **username-your_awesome_new_feature**)

### Testing

 * Now when it comes to code changes i would love you if you would add your personal test cases into the **tests** directory. This way i can **test** your addition (or changes)


## Pull Request

When you are all done and your code is valid it is time to request a pull request. There is only one rule for this **NEVER EVER** request a request a pull request on the master
branch since it always considered as stable. Please make sure you always request a pull request against a branch. If that branch does not exist please ask me politely in
an issue to create one.
