## So you want to contribute

First of all thanks for you consideration. There is a couple steps to take.

### Setup

 * First things first you will need a fork of the code. You can use the fork button on Github to accomplish this.
 * Create a new branch named like **username-your-awsome-feature-name**
 * Make your changes
 * Commit your changes
 * Don't forget to push them to your repository (Remember your branch **username-your-awsome-feature-name**)

### Testing

 * Now when it comes to code changes i would love you for you to add your personal testcases in the **tests** directory so i can **test** your addition (or changes)


## Pull Request

When you are all done and your code is valid its time to request a pull request to me. There is only one rule for this NEVER EVER request a request a pull request on the master
branch since it always seen as somewhat stable. Please make sure you always request a pull request against a branch and if that branch does not exist please ask me politely in
an issue to create one.
