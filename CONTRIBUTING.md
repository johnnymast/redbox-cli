## So you want to contribute

First of all thanks for you consideration. There is a couple steps to take.

### Setup

 * First things first you will need a fork of the code you can use the fork button on github to accomplish this.
 * Create a new branch called <new feature name here>
 * Make your changes.

### Testing

 * Now when it comes to code changes it would love you for you to add your personal testcases in the test directory so i can test your addition (or changes)


## Pull Request
When you are all done and your code is valid its time to request a pull request to me. There is only one rule for this NEVER EVER request a request a pull request on the master
branch since it always seen as somewhat stable. Please make sure you always request a pull request against a branch and if that branch does not exist please ask me politely in
an issue to create one.
